Each time an individual completes service at a service station, a data record of that service is kept.
The records should look something like the table below:

    +--------+-------+------+--------------+-----------+--------------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+-----------+-------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
    | I.D    | Class | Node | Arrival Date | Wait Time | Service Start Date | Service Time | Service End Date | Time Blocked | Exit Date | Dest. | Queue Size at Arrival | Queue Size at Depart. |

You may access these records as a list of named tuples, using the Simulation's :code:`get_all_records` method::

    >>> recs = Q.get_all_records() # doctest:+SKIP

The data records contained in this list are named tuples with the following variable names:

    - :code:`id_number`
       - The unique identification number for that customer.
    - :code:`customer_class`
       - The number of that customer's customer class. If dynamic customer classes are used, this is the customer's previous class, before a new customer class is sampled after service.
    - :code:`node`
       - The number of the node at which the service took place.
    - :code:`arrival_date`
       - The date of arrival to that node, the date which the customer joined the queue.
    - :code:`waiting_time`
       - The amount of time the customer spent waiting for service at that node.
    - :code:`service_start_date`
       - The date at which service began at that node.
    - :code:`service_time`
       - The amount of time spent in service at that node.
    - :code:`service_end_date`
       - The date which the customer finished their service at that node.
    - :code:`time_blocked`
       - The amount of time spent blocked at that node. That is the time between finishing service at exiting the node.
    - :code:`exit_date`
       - The date which the customer exited the node. This may be immediatly after service if no blocking occured, or after some period of being blocked.
    - :code:`destination`
       - The number of the customer's destination, that is the next node the customer will join after leaving the current node. If the customer leaves the system, this will be -1.
    - :code:`queue_size_at_arrival`
       - The size of the queue at the customer's arrival date. Does not include the individual themselves.
    - :code:`queue_size_at_departure`
       - The size of the queue at the customer's exit date. Does not include the individual themselves.
