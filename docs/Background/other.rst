Other Computer Simulation Options
=================================

Ciw is just one way in which simulations of queueing networks can be carried out.
Here is a list of other options that may be of interest, both commercial and open source:

- `SimPy <https://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
- `SIMUL8 <http://www.simul8.com/>`_
- `AnyLogic <http://www.anylogic.com>`_
- `Khronos <http://khronos-des.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `NetSim <http://www.boson.com/netsim-cisco-network-simulator>`_
- `Arena <https://www.arenasimulation.com/>`_

For a comparison of Ciw with other simulation tools, in terms of reproducibility and performance, see `Ciw: An open-source discrete event simulation library <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17477778.2018.1473909>`_ in the Journal of Simulation.
