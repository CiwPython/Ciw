Welcome to Ciw's documentation!
===============================

Ciw is a discrete event simulation library for open queueing networks.
Its core features include the capability to simulate networks of queues,
multiple customer classes, and implementation of Type I blocking for restricted
networks.
A number of other features are also implemented, including priorities, baulking,
reneging, schedules, batch arrivals, dynamic customer classes, and deadlock
detection.

The name **Ciw** is the Welsh word for a queue.

Ciw is currently supported for and regularly tested on Python versions 3.7,
3.8 and 3.9.
