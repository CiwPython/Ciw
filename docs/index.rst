Welcome to Ciw's documentation!
===============================

Ciw is a discrete event simulation library for open queueing networks.
Its core features include the capability to simulate networks of queues,
multiple customer classes, and implementation of Type I blocking for
restricted networks.
A number of other features are also implemented, including priorities,
baulking, reneging, schedules, slotted services, batch arrivals, service
disciplines, dynamic customer classes, and deadlock detection.

The name **Ciw** is the Welsh word for a queue.

Ciw is currently supported for and regularly tested on Python versions 3.8,
3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.
