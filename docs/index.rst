Welcome to Ciw's documentation!
===============================

Ciw is a discrete event simulation library for open queueing networks.
Its core features include the capability to simulate networks of queues, multiple customer classes, and implementation of Type I blocking for restricted networks.
A number of other features are also implemented, including priorities, baulking, schedules, and deadlock detection.

The name **Ciw** is the Welsh word for a queue.

Ciw is currently supported for and regularly tested on Python versions 3.6, 3.7
and 3.8.
