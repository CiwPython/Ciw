How to Set Dynamic Customer Classes
===================================

Ciw allows customers to probabilistically change their class after service.
That is after service at node `k` a customer of class `i` will become class `j` with probability :math:`P(J=j \; | \; I=i, K=k)`.
These probabilities are input into the system through the :code:`class_change_matrices` keyword.

Consider a one node system with three classes of customer.
After service (at Node 1) customers always change customer class, equally likely between the two other customer classes.
The :code:`class_change_matrices` for this system are shown below:

.. math::

    \begin{pmatrix}
    0.0 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
    0.5 & 0.0 & 0.5 \\
    0.5 & 0.5 & 0.0 \\
    \end{pmatrix}


This is input into the simulation model by including :code:`class_change_matrices` keyword when creating a Network object::
    
    >>> import ciw
    >>> N = ciw.create_network(
    ...     arrival_distributions={'Class 0': [ciw.dists.Exponential(rate=5)],
    ...                            'Class 1': [ciw.dists.NoArrivals()],
    ...                            'Class 2': [ciw.dists.NoArrivals()]},
    ...     service_distributions={'Class 0': [ciw.dists.Exponential(rate=10)],
    ...                            'Class 1': [ciw.dists.Exponential(rate=10)],
    ...                            'Class 2': [ciw.dists.Exponential(rate=10)]},
    ...     routing={'Class 0': [[1.0]],
    ...              'Class 1': [[1.0]],
    ...              'Class 2': [[1.0]]},
    ...     class_change_matrices={'Node 1': [[0.0, 0.5, 0.5],
    ...                                       [0.5, 0.0, 0.5],
    ...                                       [0.5, 0.5, 0.0]]},
    ...     number_of_servers=[1]
    ... )

Notice in this network only arrivals from Class 0 customer occur.
Running this system, we'll see that the count of the number of records with customer classes 1 and 2 more than zero, as some Class 0 customers have changed class after service::

    >>> from collections import Counter
    >>> ciw.seed(1)
    >>> Q = ciw.Simulation(N)
    >>> Q.simulate_until_max_time(50.0)
    >>> recs = Q.get_all_records()
    >>> Counter([r.customer_class for r in recs])
    Counter({0: 251, 2: 115, 1: 107})


Note that when more than one node is used, each node requires a class change matrix.
This means than difference class change matrices can be used for each node.
